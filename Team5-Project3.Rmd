## Reading original dataset

```{r read-csv}

orig_file <- read_csv("glassdoor_jobs.csv") |>
  mutate(job_id = row_number()) |>
  rename_with(~ tolower(gsub(" ", "_", .x, fixed = TRUE))) |>
  relocate(job_id, .before = "job_title") 

company <- subset(orig_file, select = c(company_name, location, size, founded, type_of_ownership, industry, sector, revenue))

job <- subset(orig_file, select = c(job_id, job_title, salary_estimate, job_description))
# no skills column, would need to extract from description column
skills <- subset(orig_file, select = c(job_id, job_description))

head(orig_file)
  
```
